      "OIC: The Organization of the Islamic Conference (An Introduction to An Islamic Political Institution)",
    edition: "Hardcover",
    author: " Abdullah Al Ahsan (Author)",
    description:
      "This book, The Organization of the Islamic Conference, is a premier analytical study of a major international political organization that has emerged for the first time in modern history as an important and unique international forum and political voice for the Muslim World. Dr. Abdullah al-Ahsan traces the organization's Islamic historical and political roots back to the emergence of the Muslim nation and state as early as the sixth century A.C.. Dating its current formation and history from 1492 / 1972, he details the ummatic orientations and functions of the organization with respect to structure, membership, decision making, economic, cultural, social, and political function and cooperation.  Al-Ahsan provides a thorough examination of how the OIC has navigated the complexities of international diplomacy while striving to uphold Islamic values and principles. He discusses the organization's efforts in promoting economic development, educational initiatives, and cultural exchanges among member states. The book also delves into the OIC's role in mediating conflicts and fostering political stability within the Muslim world. Additionally, al-Ahsan addresses the challenges the OIC faces, including political divergences among member countries and external geopolitical pressures. Through meticulous research and insightful analysis, this work not only chronicles the history and achievements of the OIC but also evaluates its potential future trajectory in a rapidly changing global landscape. Al-Ahsan's book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the significance of the OIC and its impact on international relations and the global Muslim community.",

      "Professor Abdullah al-Ahsan's concept of the 'Ummah' delves into the Islamic notion of a global community bound by faith, transcending ethnic, racial, and national boundaries. He explores the historical and spiritual foundations of the Ummah, highlighting its role in fostering unity, justice, and cooperation among Muslims worldwide. Al-Ahsan contrasts this with the modern concept of nation-states, which are typically defined by geographical and political boundaries. His work emphasizes the potential of the Ummah to address contemporary global challenges by promoting a sense of shared identity and mutual responsibility among Muslims. Through his scholarly analysis, he underscores the importance of reviving and nurturing the Ummah to achieve greater social harmony and ethical governance.",

      "This textbook has been written for the Junior High level. The History of the al-Khilafah ar-Rashidah deals with one of the most important periods of Islamic History. Following the Sunnah, this period established the principles of Shura (Consultation), responsible government, rule of law, the welfare system and human rights. The age of the 'Righteous' Caliphs represents an age who is principles embody the archetypical Islamic State. Yet this period also saw the Fitnah, a vile splitting up of the Muslim community. This textbook attempts to make this very complex situation understandable to the adolescent reader. Twenty-six lessons cover major events that characterized the period of each of the four Rightly Guided Khalifahs, including Abu Bakr As-Saddiq, 'Umar ibn Al Khattab, Uthman ibn 'Affan and Ali ibn Abu Talib (ra).

    edition: "Paperback – January 1, 2010",
    author: " Dr. Abdullah al-Ahsan (Author)",
    description:
      "The Search for an Alternative Paradigm by Abdullah al-Ahsan critically examines Samuel Huntington's controversial 'Clash of Civilizations' thesis, which posits that future conflicts will be primarily cultural, especially between the Western and Islamic worlds. Al-Ahsan challenges this perspective by exploring historical and contemporary interactions between civilizations, emphasizing the potential for peaceful coexistence and mutual understanding. In his analysis, al-Ahsan delves into the rich history of cooperation and dialogue between the Muslim world and other civilizations, advocating for an alternative paradigm rooted in shared values and collaborative problem-solving. He argues that instead of viewing cultural differences as sources of inevitable conflict, they should be seen as opportunities for enrichment and cooperation. The book offers a comprehensive critique of the clash of civilizations theory, presenting a nuanced view of global interactions and proposing a framework that encourages intercultural dialogue and cooperation. Through this work, al-Ahsan seeks to promote a more optimistic and constructive approach to international relations, emphasizing the role of mutual respect and understanding in building a harmonious global community.",

      "Elite-Formation Under Colonial Rule: Capable Administrators or Loyal Servants? A General Survey of Colonial Rule in Muslim Countries by Abdullah al-Ahsan critically examines how colonial powers in Muslim countries developed local administrative elites. Al-Ahsan explores whether these elites were trained as effective leaders or primarily as loyal servants to the colonial regime. The book analyzes the long-term impacts of colonial strategies on governance, social structures, and post-colonial state-building. By surveying various Muslim countries, al-Ahsan sheds light on the complexities of colonial influence, providing valuable insights into the historical processes that shaped contemporary political landscapes in the Muslim world.",
