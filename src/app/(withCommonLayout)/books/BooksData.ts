      "THE HISTORY OF AL-KHILAFAH AR-RASHIDAH THE HISTORY OF AL-KHILAFAH AR-RASHIDAH Dr. `Abdullah al-Ahsan Primarily written for young readers and students, The History of Al-Khilafah deals with the most important period in the Islamic history. Following the Prophet’s Sunnah, it established the principles of Shura, responsible government, rule of law, welfare system and human rights. The Khilafah represents the principles of Islamic state and governance later looked to as the norms of Islamic state and its politics. It is also a period which saw, during later years, the rise of Fitnah and the establishment of a dynastic rule; a complex situation that is very difficult to understand for a young reader. Dr. Abdullah al-Ahsan, a veteran historian, deals with the sensitive issues of the time with great sympathy and wisdom. Dr. Abdullah Ghazi has added two final chapters to describe the uniqueness of both the Khulafah and the system of Khilafah they established.",
